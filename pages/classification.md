Tree Species Classification for the University Forest Caldern
-------------------------------------------------------------

This is a preview of the map for the classification of tree species for the University Forest Caldern. Unfortunatley, due to
file size limitations on github, the fully interactive version of the
[map](http://seminar.environmentalinformatics-marburg.de/Seminar_RS/classification.html)
is hosted by servers of the Environmental Informatics Department of the
University of Marburg. Be aware that the file size is above 100 MB.

The classification is based on a [Random Forest
Classifier](https://github.com/goergen95/mof_caldern/blob/master/src/010_rf_classification.R)
trained in a 5-fold cross-validation and a [forward feature
selection](rf.html).
