Number of direct neighbours for each individual tree
----------------------------------------------------------

This is the map of the number of direct neighbours for the University Forest Caldern. Be aware that the file size is above **100 MB**.

This index was calculated by a ten centimeter buffer and counting the
intersecting polygons in the neihborhood of each segment. The code to
calculate the [direct
neigbours](https://github.com/goergen95/mof_caldern/blob/master/src/011_structure_values.R#L142)
can be seen here. It thus indicates some measure of competition. By
clicking on polygons you will get additional information including:
