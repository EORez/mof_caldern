Overview of the Biodiversity Index at a 1 acre environment
-----------------------------------------------------------

This is a preview of the map for tree species biodiversity for the
University Forest Caldern. Unfortunatley, due to file size limitations
on github, the fully interactive version of the
[map](http://seminar.environmentalinformatics-marburg.de/Seminar_RS/biodiversity.html)
is hosted by servers of the Environmental Informatics Department of the
University of Marburg. Be aware that the file size is above 100 MB.

The biodiversity index is based on a one-acre environment for every tree
and then
[calculating](https://github.com/goergen95/mof_caldern/blob/master/src/011_structure_values.R#L173)
the Shannon-Weaver Entropy index for the different species present in
the neighbourhood. At this scale, it gives a good overview of
biodiversity hotspots in the forest area.
