Vertical density map for the University Forest Caldern
-------------------------------------------------------------

This is a preview of the map of vertical density for the University Forest Caldern. Unfortunatley, due to
file size limitations on github, the fully interactive version of the
[map](http://seminar.environmentalinformatics-marburg.de/Seminar_RS/density.html)
is hosted by servers of the Environmental Informatics Department of the
University of Marburg. Be aware that the file size is above 100 MB.

This
[index](https://github.com/goergen95/mof_caldern/blob/master/src/011_structure_values.R#L97)
was calculated by averaging the proportion of above ground LIDAR returns
from all returns for each individual tree. The code to calculate this
index can be accessed here.
