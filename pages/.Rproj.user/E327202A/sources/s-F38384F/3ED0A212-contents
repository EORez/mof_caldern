## Entropy of certical density for the University Forest Caldern
This is a preview of the map for tree species biodiversity in a 30 meter environment for the University Forest Caldern.
Unfortunatley, due to file size limitations on github, the fully interactive version of the [map](http://seminar.environmentalinformatics-marburg.de/Seminar_RS/biodiversity30.html) is hosted by servers of the Environmental Informatics Department of the University of Marburg. Be aware that the file size is above 100 MB.

This [index](https://github.com/GeoMOER-Students-Space/mpg-envinfosys-teams-2018-rs_18_axmideda/blob/master/src/011_structure_values.R#L97) was calculated by averaging the proportion of above ground LIDAR returns from all returns for each individual tree. The code to calculate this index can be accessed here. 

```{r echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
intens = colorRampPalette(c("lemonchiffon","darkolivegreen3","forestgreen"))
mapview::mapview(species, zcol = c("dens"),
                 color = "grey",
                 at = seq(0,1,0.02),
                 col.regions = intens(51),
                 na.color = "grey",
                 lwd = 0.1,
                 legend = TRUE,
                 layer.name = "Vertical Vegetation Density")
