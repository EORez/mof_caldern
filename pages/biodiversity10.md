Overview of the Biodiversity Index at a 10 meters environment
-------------------------------------------------------------

This is the map for tree species biodiversity in a 30 meter
environment for the University Forest Caldern. Be aware that the file size is approximately **100 MB**.

The index is based on a 10 meter environment for every tree and then
[calculating](https://github.com/goergen95/mof_caldern/blob/master/src/011_structure_values.R#L173)
the Shannon-Weaver Entropy index for the different species present in
the neighbourhood. At this scale, it gives a good overview of
biodiversity hotspots in the forest area.
